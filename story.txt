In a time before time the world was formless and null.
Shapes emerged only slowly, at random, and nothing had purpose.
Finally, the first lfe arose, and began to wonder.

This life was Deb Deppler. Deb, a being as old as time began to raom the earth.
What she saw was nothing. As the good programmer that she is, the first
 thing she created was a message, Hello World.

The world began to rise, and creature appeared on the land.
In a second, her brain ran out of stack.
